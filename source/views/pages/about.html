    <h3 class="page-section__title">Why is it so hard to fund a growing <br> Amazon business?</h3>
    <div class="page-section__content">
      <p class="article-text">That’s the question I kept asking myself. My Amazon business was booming, with revenue
        into the millions, but I
        came up empty handed every time I tried to get a business loan. I’d spend hours being force-fed high pressure
        sales tactics by fast-talking salesmen, filling out application forms, digging up documents, and cleaning up
        financial statements – only to be given an offer with horrible terms, or flat-out rejected.</p>

      <div class="callout">
        <p>In the age of Amazon, the lending industry is stuck in its ways. My business didn’t fit the mold, so they saw
          me as a massive risk.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="article-text">After growing a multi-million dollar Amazon business from a rented bedroom in a NYC
        apartment, I had first-hand
        knowledge of the problems sellers face. It’s next to impossible to stay several months ahead of a fast-growing
        business, leading to stockouts or forced cutbacks in other areas.</p>

      <p class="article-text">With amzLenders, I wanted to create the perfect solution which would have made my path to
        success faster,
        easier, and far less stressful. While other lenders will search for ways to bleed your business dry, I wanted to
        lend at lower rates. I envisioned a simple, friendly, and painless way for Amazon sellers, like us, to finance
        the growth of lasting businesses. I wanted to create a different kind of lending company – one that thrives on
        honesty, transparency, technology, and fresh thinking.</p>

  <div class="page-section l-about">
    <h3 class="page-section__title">No fast talking salesmen. No credit scores. <br>
      No burdensome paperwork. No insane contracts.</h3>
    <div class="page-section__content">
      <p class="article-text">We painstakingly combed through every step of the process to eliminate needless effort,
        confusion, and stress –
        while passing the cost savings to you in the form of lower fees. With stress-free payments and crystal clear
        rates, you’ll know exactly how much you’ll pay before you sign the contract.</p>

          through the challenges.</p>
      </div>

      <p class="article-text">If you have a healthy Amazon business, it shouldn’t be a nightmare to find funding. So
        when we realized nothing
        perfect existed, we built the ideal solution from the ground up. And unlike the rest of the lending industry, we
        know that when your business flourishes, ours can too.</p>

      <p class="article-text">Entrepreneurship is in our blood, and we’re proud to play a part in your success story.
